# UB Art Gallery Experience
UB Art Gallery Experience is a project made for Google Cardboard that allows people to experience the University at Buffaloâ€™s student lead art gallery located in the Center for the Arts. In the  modern technological age, many people have access to Virtual Reality (VR) without really realizing it. We are able to download apps onto our smartphones that allow us to experience VR. Compared to other VR options such as the Oculus Rift or the HTC Vive, Google Cardboard is a much more cost efficient access to VR. Our idea was to allow students interested in coming to University at Buffalo (UB) tour the campus without needing to come to the campus. This would be a quick way for students to look around UB without needing to leave their homes. We knew it would be difficult to capture the whole campus so to scale things down we decided to capture the art gallery instead.
